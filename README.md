# Harassment corpus
Publishing a Quality Context-aware Annotated Corpus andLexicon for Harassment Research.

Identifying profane or offensive words are a standard way of starting the investigation over cyberbullying incident.
Thereafter, initially we created a lexicon form the profane words and we divided our dictionary into the six context; 1) Sexual 2) Appearance-related 3) Intellectual 4) Political 5) Racial 6) Combined. We utilized the first five categories of our lexiconas seed terms for collecting tweets from Twitter. Using at least one offensive word,we collected 10,000 tweets for each contextual type for a total of 50,000. Using offensive words in a given tweet does not assure that thetweet is harassing because individuals might utilize the offensivewords in a friendly manner or quotes. Therefore, we rely on hu-man judged annotations for discriminating harassing tweets fromnot-harassing tweets.
